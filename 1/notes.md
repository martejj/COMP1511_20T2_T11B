What is an operating system?

What operating systems do your classmates run? The tute room? The CSE lab computers?

What are the differences between each of the various operating systems? What differences are there in their interfaces, and how do you interact with them?

What are some different ways in which you can interact with a computer?

What are the differences between graphical user interfaces and the command line? When might one be better than the other?
