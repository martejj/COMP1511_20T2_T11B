## Noteworthy points

* RECORD
* Today we will cover characters and strings + more input/output

## assignment 1

Well done everyone for such a great effort in the first assignment.

Take a moment to think about how you found the assignment, and what you learned in the process of working on it.

If you could go back in time to the very start of the assignment, and give one piece of advice to your past self, what would you say?

Your tutor will talk about how you will get feedback from the marking of assignment 1.

## Q2 - What is a character?

So far in this course we have learnt about two data types - int and double. What about a char variable? What is the size of this variable, and what possible values can it have? What do these values mean?

## Q3 - Answer the following questions on putchar, getchar and fgets.

How do we use getchar and putchar? How does getchar signal to us that it has reached the end of the input?

Why does getchar return an int instead of a char?

How do we use fgets? How does fgets signal to us that it has reached the end of the input?

When fgets scans in a line of text, will it include a '\n' at the end of the line? Is this always the case?

## is_upper.c

Write a function with prototype `int isUpper(char ch)` that returns true if the character given is upper case and false otherwise.

## filter_upper.c

Write a program that removes all upper case letters from input and prints it out. Use is_upper.c and `getchar()` and `putchar()` until EOF.

```c 
    $ ./filter_upper
    abcDEFghi
    abcghi
```

## What is a string?

How do we declare a string?

Answer
</summary>

An array of characters with a `\0` at the end to signify the finish.

## Q4) What does this code do?

```c
    int secret_function(char *word) {
        int i = 0;
        int result = 0;
        while (word[i] != '\0') {
            if(word[i] >= 'a' && word[i] <= 'z') {
                result++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return result;
    }
```

Can you explain the stopping case in the while loop? Why does it work and what is the significance of the '\0'?

What does the char *word input mean? What's the relationship between an array and a pointer?

## spongebobify.c

Write a program that reads in a string from the user and spongebobifies it. hint: use fgets() .

## What is a struct? What are the differences between structs and arrays?
